# Image Resources for MIT App Inventor Project

The following images are required for the Yoga Pose Recognizer app:

## 1. star1.png
- A simple gold star with orange outline
- Dimensions: Approximately 200x200 pixels
- Should be in PNG format with transparent background
- Purpose: Displays when a yoga pose is correctly recognized

## 2. pose1.png (Mountain Pose - Tadasana)
- Simple line drawing or silhouette of a person standing straight with arms at sides
- Dimensions: Approximately 200x300 pixels

## Notes for Implementation
1. These images should be uploaded to the MIT App Inventor project through the Media panel
2. The images should be simple and clearly recognizable
3. Line drawings work better than photographs for this purpose
4. Make sure each image has a transparent background for better integration with the app interface
