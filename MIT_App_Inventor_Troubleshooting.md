# MIT App Inventor Blocks Loading Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Understanding the Error
The error message "The blocks area did not load properly. Changes to the blocks for screen [ID]_Screen1 will not be saved" typically occurs when:

1. There is corruption in the project's blocks file
2. There are version compatibility issues between the saved project and your current MIT App Inventor instance
3. The project contains blocks or components that are no longer supported
4. Your browser cache/storage has corruption

## Solution 1: Clean Project Import/Export

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Create a fresh project in MIT App Inventor**
   - Log into MIT App Inventor
   - Create a completely new project with a different name (e.g., "YogaPoseRecognizer_Fresh")

2. **Import components one by one**
   - Instead of importing the entire .aia file, build the project incrementally
   - First, add only the essential components (Buttons, Labels, WebViewer)
   - Save and verify blocks load correctly between each major addition

3. **Manual block recreation**
   - Instead of copying blocks, rebuild them manually in the new project
   - Start with the simplest functionality (e.g., button clicks)
   - Progress to more complex logic only after verifying simpler blocks work

## Solution 2: Browser Cache/Storage Reset

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   - In Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
   - Select "Cookies and site data" and "Cached images and files"
   - Time range: "All time"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Try a different browser**
   - If using Chrome, try Firefox or Edge
   - If already using Firefox, try Chrome

3. **Use incognito/private browsing mode**
   - This uses a fresh browser environment without existing cache

## Solution 3: Project Recovery Through File Editing

If you're comfortable editing XML files, you can try this advanced approach:

1. **Extract the .aia file** (it's a ZIP file)
   - Rename YogaPoseRecognizer.aia to YogaPoseRecognizer.zip
   - Extract the contents to a folder

2. **Locate the blocks file**
   - Navigate to src/appinventor/[your_username]/[project_name]/Screen1.bky

3. **Edit the file to remove corruption**
   - Open Screen1.bky in a text editor
   - Look for blocks with unusual IDs or malformed XML
   - Either:
     a) Remove problematic blocks completely, OR
     b) Fix the XML structure if issues are apparent

4. **Repackage the .aia file**
   - Zip the modified contents back into a .zip file
   - Rename the .zip file to .aia

5. **Import the fixed project**
   - Import the modified .aia file into MIT App Inventor

## Solution 4: Use the Debug Version

The debug version we created (YogaPoseRecognizer_Debug_v1.1.1.aia) uses a completely rebuilt blocks file structure to avoid the corruption issue. Try using it as follows:

1. Download the debug version from GitHub
2. Import it as a new project in MIT App Inventor
3. Verify the blocks load correctly
4. If successful, gradually add any missing functionality

## Solution 5: Use the Minimal Version

We've created a minimal version (YogaPoseRecognizer_Minimal.aia) that includes only the essential components and blocks needed for basic pose recognition. This stripped-down version is less likely to have block loading issues:

1. Download the minimal version
2. Import it as a new project in MIT App Inventor
3. Verify the blocks load correctly
4. Once working, gradually add features from your original project one at a time, testing blocks loading after each addition

## Prevention Tips for Future Projects

1. **Make frequent backups**
   - Export your project .aia file regularly
   - Keep version numbers to track changes

2. **Use simple block structures**
   - Avoid extremely complex or deeply nested blocks
   - Break large procedures into smaller, manageable ones

3. **Regularly clear browser cache**
   - Clear cache before working on important projects
   - Use a dedicated browser just for MIT App Inventor

4. **Keep MIT App Inventor extensions updated**
   - Outdated extensions can cause compatibility issues

Remember that MIT App Inventor projects can sometimes be sensitive to browser-specific issues, so trying different browsers can be an effective troubleshooting step.
