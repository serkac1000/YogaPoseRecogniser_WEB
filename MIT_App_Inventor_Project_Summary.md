# Yoga Pose Recognizer - Project Summary

## Project Goal
Create a Yoga Pose Recognition application using MIT App Inventor that:
1. Uses the device camera to capture images
2. Recognizes three distinct yoga poses using Teachable Machine
3. Guides users through a sequence of poses (Pose 1 → Pose 2 → Pose 3 → Pose 1)
4. Provides visual feedback when poses are correctly performed

## What's Included

I've prepared a comprehensive set of resources to help you implement the MIT App Inventor project:

1. **Implementation Documentation**
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Component configuration details
   - Programming logic explanations
   - Visual block arrangement guides

2. **Resource Files**
   - SVG file for the star image (needs to be converted to PNG for MIT App Inventor)
   - Details on required images for the yoga poses

3. **ZIP Archive**
   - `YogaPoseRecognizer_Project.zip` contains all implementation files
   - Download this file to access all resources in one package

## How to Use These Resources

1. **Understand the Project**
   - Read `mit_app_inventor_project/README.md` first for an overview
   - Review `mit_app_inventor_project/YogaPoseRecognizer_Instructions.md` for component details

2. **Implement in MIT App Inventor**
   - Follow the step-by-step guide in `mit_app_inventor_project/YogaPoseRecognizer_Implementation.md`
   - Reference `mit_app_inventor_project/blocks_visualization.md` for block arrangement
   - Prepare images as described in `mit_app_inventor_project/image_resources.md`

3. **Test and Deploy**
   - Use MIT App Inventor's AI Companion to test on your device
   - Export as .aia file for sharing or future editing
   - Optionally build an APK for direct installation

## Important Notes

1. **Teachable Machine Model**
   - A model has been trained and is available at: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/gIF64n3nR/
   - You'll need to download the Teachable Machine Extension (.aix file) for MIT App Inventor

2. **Required Images**
   - You'll need to create or source images for:
     - A star (for visual feedback)
     - Three yoga poses (for visual reference)
   - Convert the provided star1.svg to PNG format for use in MIT App Inventor

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - This project provides detailed documentation rather than a direct .aia file
   - Following the step-by-step guides will result in a fully functional application

## Next Steps

1. Download the ZIP file containing all resources
2. Follow the implementation guides to build the app in MIT App Inventor
3. Test the app on your Android device
4. Share the app with others by exporting as .aia or APK

Feel free to modify and enhance the app with additional features such as:
- Sound feedback for successful poses
- Timers for holding poses
- Progress tracking
- Custom sequences of poses
