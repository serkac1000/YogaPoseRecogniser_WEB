# Yoga Pose Recognizer - Implementation Summary

## App Overview

The Yoga Pose Recognizer is a mobile application built with MIT App Inventor that uses the Teachable Machine extension to recognize yoga poses through the device's camera. This implementation leverages machine learning to provide real-time feedback on yoga practice.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Pose Detection**: Uses the device camera to detect yoga poses in real-time
2. **Multiple Pose Recognition**: Capable of recognizing three different yoga poses
3. **Confidence Metrics**: Displays confidence levels for pose detection
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shows reference images and star animations for successful poses
5. **Guided Practice**: Includes a sequence mode that guides users through a series of poses
6. **Camera Controls**: Allows toggling between front and rear cameras

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used

- **TeachableMachine Extension**: For pose classification
- **PersonalImageClassifier**: Alternative classifier for pose detection
- **WebViewer**: To display the camera feed for analysis
- **Clock**: For timing the sequence mode transitions
- **Images**: Reference visuals for each yoga pose
- **Buttons**: For user interaction and control
- **Labels**: To display status and instruction text
- **Arrangements**: For organizing the UI layout

### Machine Learning Model

The app uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (`modelLHRHBOTHHAND.mdl`) that has been trained to recognize specific yoga poses. The model analyzes video frames from the device camera and returns confidence scores for each possible pose classification.

### App Logic

1. **Initialization**: When the app starts, it loads the machine learning model and enables the interface buttons.

2. **Pose Detection**: 
   - The app continuously captures frames from the camera
   - Each frame is analyzed by the TeachableMachine component
   - Detection results are processed to determine the highest confidence pose
   - Feedback is provided through visual and textual elements

3. **Sequence Mode**:
   - Tracks the current expected pose (Pose 1 → Pose 2 → Pose 3 → Pose 1)
   - Monitors for successful detection of the current expected pose
   - Automatically advances to the next pose when the current one is detected
   - Provides guided instruction through the "Next Pose" label

4. **Feedback System**:
   - Displays confidence percentage for detected poses
   - Shows a star animation when confidence exceeds 50%
   - Displays reference images for visual guidance
   - Updates text labels with detection status

## User Interface Elements

1. **Top Section**:
   - Current pose detection label
   - Start/Stop button and camera toggle

2. **Middle Section**:
   - Sequence mode control
   - Star animation (appears on successful detection)
   - Confidence display

3. **Bottom Section**:
   - Reference pose images
   - Next pose indicator (for sequence mode)

## Customization Potential

The app can be easily customized by:
- Replacing the machine learning model with a different one
- Adding more pose types to the detection system
- Customizing the reference images
- Adjusting confidence thresholds
- Creating more complex pose sequences

## Technical Requirements

- MIT App Inventor 2
- TeachableMachine extension installed
- Mobile device with camera support
- Internet connection (for initial model loading)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for yoga pose recognition that can be extended with additional features as needed.
