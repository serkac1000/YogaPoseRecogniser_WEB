# Fixing MIT App Inventor Blocks Loading Issues

If you're experiencing the error message "The blocks area did not load properly. Changes to the blocks for screen [ID]_Screen1 will not be saved", follow this step-by-step guide to resolve the issue.

## Quick Fixes (Try these first)

### Method 1: Clear Browser Cache and Try Again
1. Clear your browser cache and cookies completely
2. Close and reopen your browser
3. Log back into MIT App Inventor
4. Try loading your project again

### Method 2: Use a Different Browser
1. If using Chrome, try Firefox (or vice versa)
2. Try using an Incognito/Private window
3. Import your project and check if blocks load properly

## Using the Provided Alternative Versions

If the quick fixes don't work, we've created two alternative versions of the app to help you overcome this issue:

### Option 1: Use the Debug Version
The debug version (YogaPoseRecognizer_Debug_v1.1.1.aia) has been completely rebuilt with a focus on stability:

1. Download YogaPoseRecognizer_Debug_v1.1.1.aia from the GitHub repository
2. In MIT App Inventor, create a new project
3. Use "Import project (.aia) from my computer" and select the debug version
4. Open the Blocks Editor to verify blocks load correctly
5. This version includes all functionality plus additional logging for troubleshooting

### Option 2: Use the Minimal Version
The minimal version (YogaPoseRecognizer_Minimal.aia) contains only the essential components for basic pose recognition:

1. Download YogaPoseRecognizer_Minimal.aia from the GitHub repository
2. Create a new project in MIT App Inventor
3. Import the minimal version
4. Verify blocks load correctly
5. This version is a foundation you can build upon by gradually adding features

## Building Your Project From Scratch

If you prefer to rebuild your project completely:

1. Create a brand new project in MIT App Inventor
2. Add components one at a time:
   - WebViewer (for camera)
   - TeachableMachine extension
   - Labels for displaying results
   - Buttons for controls
3. Build blocks methodically:
   - Start with TeachableMachine event handlers
   - Add button click handlers
   - Test blocks loading after each major addition

## Advanced Fix: Manual Project Repair

For those comfortable with file editing:

1. Rename your .aia file to .zip and extract it
2. Locate the Screen1.bky file in the extracted files
3. Open it in a text editor and look for malformed XML or unusual blocks
4. Repair or remove problematic sections
5. Repackage as a .aia file and import again

## If All Else Fails

Consider using the web application version instead. We've created a fully functional web version of the Yoga Pose Recognizer that runs in any modern browser and doesn't depend on MIT App Inventor.
